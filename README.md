### Overview

I have been tasked with creating a simple React-Native application for To-Do task tracking. This document describes how my application will look and run and itâ€™s intended functionalities. To-Do apps are widely used and there are a lot of them out there, but each person has a different preference and perspective on what they want out of these apps.
